administrator. Over the years company has acquired historical data including administratorsâ€™ 
experience, training credits and information whether the administrator completed tasks (i.e. 
yes/no). See data set in file SystemAdministrators.csv. Thus, company wants to overview 
its historic data of systems administrators before making the final decision for having a new 
colleague on-board.
